## Introduction

The **Linux OS Lab** course is designed to provide practical knowledge of Linux operating systems. This repository contains two main projects aimed at helping students and developers learn and practice essential Linux skills:

1. **Project on Linux Commands** - Understanding and mastering various Linux commands used for file management, process control, networking, and system monitoring.
2. **Project on Shell Scripting** - Writing shell scripts to automate tasks, manage system operations, and enhance productivity.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Linux Commands

#### Objectives:
- To become familiar with essential Linux commands for daily operations.
- To understand how to manage files and directories, control processes, and perform basic networking tasks.
- To learn how to use system monitoring tools and utilities.


In this project, you will practice various Linux commands that are crucial for system administration and daily tasks. You will learn commands for file management (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `find`, etc.), process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`), user management (`adduser`, `passwd`), networking (`ping`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`), and more.

**Directory Structure:**

Each script or text file contains examples and exercises for different sets of commands. Follow the instructions in `README.md` within the `Project1_LinuxCommands` directory for detailed steps on how to use these commands.

### Project 2: Shell Scripting

#### Objectives:
- To learn the basics of shell scripting and how to write scripts for task automation.
- To understand and implement control structures like loops, conditionals, and functions in shell scripts.
- To automate system administration tasks using shell scripts.

#### Description:

In this project, you will create and execute shell scripts that automate various tasks on Linux. You will cover topics such as file manipulation, user management, system monitoring, and backup automation.
